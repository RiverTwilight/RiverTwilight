I write code. Started when I was 14, though that matters less than what I've actually built. I build indie software products because I believe in individual creators making things of value. You can find some of them at [ygeeker.com](https://www.ygeeker.com).

Open source isn't just a buzzword to me - I contribute because good code should be shared and built upon. That's how progress happens.

If you have ideas, email me. Simple ideas executed well beat complicated ideas executed poorly. The best collaborations often start with a casual conversation.

And since you're reading this: do things that matter to you. Most people spend their lives doing what they think they're supposed to do instead of what interests them. Don't fall into that trap.
